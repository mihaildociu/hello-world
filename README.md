# hello-world
My name is Mihai Dociu

I've been working in the customer services domain for Optymyze since 2008. My job and subsequently, my team's work, has been consistently a mix between a BA and a "programmer" job.

"Programmer" between "" because while we develop very complex projects and products, we do not use code or a coding language. The product we use can load many different types for row-column data from several sources, upload them into an open ended data model, and from there can be processed and manipulated in unlimited ways. Anything you can do with SQL, you can do with this product, using a no-code UI.

In my role, I've been building, designing or leading projects consisting of over 100.000 table or data operations and manipulations. Examples of operations (table joins, group by's, unions, math/string/logical/date functions). The amount of processed data at the order of 10s of TB. To route so much data, thru so many custom processes with an open ended data model and to yield processing speed of under 10 hours it required a very good and powerful product, but also a very good data model design and smart algorithms. And that is what I am personally proud of, doing it myself and coaching and leading others to do it.

Nevertheless, until recently, when I started learning Python on my own, I never actually programmed per the common sense of the word. So far I'm progressing well.

I'm on GitHub to learn more about the software development ecosystem.

Thanks!
